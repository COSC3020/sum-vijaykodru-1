# Sums

The program to compute the sum of a list of numbers in `code.js` is incorrect
(and the tests in `code.test.js` are failing). Correct the code such that it
passes the tests.

I did the following exercise on my own. The test are failing because in the original code the sum variable is initialized to be the first element of the given array and in the for loop we also start by adding that same first element. I have changed the sum variable to be 0 initially which will make the code run without errors 

I certify that I have listed all sources used to complete this exercise, including the use of any Large Language Models. All of the work is my own, except where stated otherwise. I am aware that plagiarism carries severe penalties and that if plagiarism is suspected, charges may be filed against me without prior notice.
